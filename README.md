# Powder

This is my attempt to impliment a basic programming language featuring a simple syntax,
virtual machine, and a compiler targeting that virtual machine.  Run-time features include
cooperative, single-threaded concurrency, and automatic memory management using garbage
collection.  A major design goal is to try to be as small and simple as possible.
The VM lends itself to procedural-style programming languages, supports basic system
calls for console input and output, list containers, and basic math operations.
