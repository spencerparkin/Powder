TO-DO...

-- Maybe remove all exception throwing.  This is also along the effort to curb memory leaks, at least, in those cases.

-- Add cursor hover support in the source control window?  You hover over a symbol long enough and then a bubble shows up with the symbol's current value.  Not needed if the inspection window is good enough.

-- There are a few step bugs to be ironed out.  Also, the step locations (line numbers) could be refined by revisiting the instruction generator code.

-- Add column number ranges to the debug info run through and generated from the compiler.  Then highlight the appropriate text in the source file window when stepping.  Also, add ability to step one instruction at a time?  "Atomic step"?

-- Not sure how far to take the language both in terms of extension modules and language features (e.g., OOP.)  What other extension modules might I add?  Might be good to exploit the fork instruction for blocking I/O.
